# Scrum-Review
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are the primary way that I interpret user needs when making a program. These are created by conversing with stakeholders and identifying their needs and putting them to a plan in the form of an organized user story complete with priority levels and a detailed requirements list.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs first by identifying what the requirements of my customer are or if I am making something for myself I identify what I need done. I hope to incorporate agile practices such as Scrum in order to ensure the success of my program. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member involves more than just being a good programmer, you also have to have excellent communication skills and a willingness to work with others including receiving and utilizing constructive criticism where applicable.
